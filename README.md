## PuppyDB - a small express/node-sqlite app

This is a little app for playing around with the [node-sqlite](https://github.com/kriasoft/node-sqlite) library

To get started ->
* clone this repo
* `npm install`
* one time seed script (or anytime you want to add a bunch of new puppies): `node seed.js` This will create a `db.sqlite` file and seed it with 100 puppies
* to run the server: `npm run start`
* fire up [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) or write some `curl`s or the like and start making requests
